Someone had to innovate. We are happy to do the dirty work. It may not be perfect, but we are sure that once implemented, it can solve the problem faced by DEXs paving the way for near-boundless liquidity and high guarantee of trades if supported by an efficient trading engine. The trading engine itself needs a separate look and it is a whole dedicated project in itself; hence it is covered in another medium article. Let’s stick to the core protocol here.",
